# Learner Edge

Learner Edge is an application that bridges the gap between a student and a teacher in the pandemic era. It lets students book personal appointments from their teachers for one to one doubt clearance/mentoring. Students can view their teachersâ€™ free slots and book an appointment with them. The teachers can view the list of students who have booked slots with them. 


## Instructions
First, clone the repository with the 'clone' command, or just download the zip.
```
git clone https://github.com/prachi-28/Learner-Edge.git

There you go, you can now open the project. Enjoy!
